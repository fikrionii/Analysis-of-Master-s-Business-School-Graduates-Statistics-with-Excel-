## Introduction
### The Maven Business School
Maven Business School is an online startup that’s looking to disrupt the postgraduate programs offered by traditional universities.
As a Recruitment Analyst in the startup, we have data from the first graduating class of the MBA program, including details & scores from their application, the program itself, and their employment status 2 months later.

### Our Goal
Leverage statistics to evaluate the result of this class, predict the performance of future classes, and propose changes in the recruitment to improve graduate outcomes

### Our Objective
- Understand our data with descriptive statistics
- Draw conclusions with hypothesis tests
- Make predictions with regression analysis
